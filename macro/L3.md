## Keynesian Theory of Income and Employment

* He challenged the theory of say's law
* He always emphasised that government should interfere when there is unemployment
* Classicists never feel the demand os govt, only said market forces will handle everything
* Also he said Y-C (gap between output and consumpyion) may or may not be filled by savings
* Y â‰  C + S
* Equilibrium level of employment will be determined by
* **Effective Demand**
  * Intersection of Aggregate Demand and Aggregare Supply
  * When producers will invest money in employment, they will expect that they should get back that much, and they will get when their will be expenditure in the economy
  * AS - producers expectation of receiving back money / their spending in business
  * AD - expenditure in economy/producers actually getting = C + I + G(if govt expending)
  * When producers expectation and reality matches - equlibrium 
    * Need not be full employment

    * If Nf < N, demand pull inflation -> demand greater than supply
    * If Nf > N, then AD curve has to shift upward -> govt has to spend

* If there is more output in economy, 
    * Producers will not invest in next period
    * But Kayens brought govt in picture
    * Increase expenditure to create employment 
    * **Autonomous Investment** -> investment used to generate employment, not for any personal motivation
* Was short run model
* Bound to fail in long run
