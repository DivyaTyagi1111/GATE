# Classical Theory of Income and Employment

* Classical Economist - Karl, Ricardo, Smith, etc didnt produce an classical theory of income & employment. But altogether their views clubbed into theory
* They are in favor of market mechanism

* **Say's Law of Market**
  * Given by J.B. Say
  * **Supply create its own demand**
  * In the process of production, equivalent income gets generated which creates demands, so general(long run) overproduction rules out
  * There could be unemployment
  * In the long run producers will adjust to the demand
    * Producers will produce only what is being demanded
    * Or producers will create the demand of what they are producing
  * Y = C + S
  * S = I
  * Y = C + I
    * Free market will adjust the savings and investment
    * Investors will invest till the point labours are there, because after no point in investing in capitals because labours not there to run machines, so only prices would increase and not output

  * So economy will always be at full employment equilibrium, deviation could be temporary
  * Income vs Employment curve
  * Nf is full employement, then income would be constant

* **Quantitative theory of Money**
  * **MV = PY**

  * Money in circulation 
  * Velocity of Circulation (1 unit of money kitne transactions ko finance kr rha hai) - depends on consumer habit, depends on technology like credit cards - its stable at least in short run
  * General Price Level
  * Output - Stable in short run
  * PY -> national income
  * Direct relationship between money and prices 
    * M ∝ P
  * Money is only demanded for transactions
    * So it could be used for constructing aggregate demand curve
    * **MV -> Aggregate demand**

* **Flexibility of Wages**
  * The supply and demand of labours is function of wages
  * And intersection of both determines wage
  * Whosoever willing to work will get work, those who unwilling to work will be unemployed, no general unemployement

  * If supply curve below, then wages W1, wages in the market will adjust on its own
  * Wages can increase or decrease

* Now lets look into complete picture, here we will include 
  * **Real Wages** = Money Wages / Price
  * Depicts purchasing power

  * if prices increase then either Labour demand has to shift right or labour supply has to shift left

* **Critical Assessment**
  * It was done by Keynes
  * Money Price relationship is not direct
  * Wage is downward rigid - minimum wage would be there
  * The purpose of money can not be only for transactions, its used for various other things like capital estimation
  * Savings eqn not so simple
